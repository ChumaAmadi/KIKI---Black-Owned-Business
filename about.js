                        Kiki is a digital platform focused on sharing
                        stories from black womxn with a special focus on authenticity
                        and online community. Kiki was created with the intention of 
                        being a safe-space for black womxn. It is statistically proven
                        that a tenth of messages received online by black womxn 
                        are abusive.

                        We believe that there are not enough podcasts and digital
                        platforms that target primarily black womxn. This has 
                        produced a lacking amount  of safe, online communities for black womxn.
                        Kiki was created to combat this issue and more as the brand 
                        flourishes.
